# FocusUp
This is a script that runs and makes sure i stay on VSC

I used Pushover API to send me a notification on an interval as long as VSC is open (checked with psutil). 
I've started using it while I work and it's pretty effective I have started to check my phone a lot less and I'm desensitized to notifications now.
